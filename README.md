# MontyHallProblem

Also known as Game Show Host Problem.</br>
There are three doors. Only one holds the prize, and the other ones are empty. You get to choose a door. Then the game show host will open one that doesn't carry the prize and offer you to stick with the original door or switch to the unopened one. Well, just switch to that door, try the simulation, you'll see.</br>
